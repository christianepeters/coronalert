# Coronalert

The [Coronalert][CA] is a privacy-preserving contact tracing app launched in Belgium. The app is based on the [DP-3T protocol][DP3T].

Here we provide a [python script](checkcode.py) to see if a test code was generated correctly. The specs are given in the appendix "Computation of the error detection code modulo 97" in the [Coronalert technical specification][CASD].
